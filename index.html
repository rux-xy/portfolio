      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>I want to blend my love for physical discipline and digital creativity. Long-term, I hope to develop tech that enhances learning, powers games, or even integrates robotics in fun and practical ways. And yes â€” maybe even build my own fighting game or robot one day.</p>

    <section id="approach" class="section">
      <h2>My Approach to Work</h2>
      <p>I work with intensity whether itâ€™s writing code or throwing punches. I love solving problems hands-on, learning by breaking things, fixing them, and doing it all over again better. I approach everything with curiosity, creativity, and a bit of stubbornness.</p>
